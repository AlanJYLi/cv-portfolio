#### Introduction
Master Data Science Challenge 2020 is a data science competition held by Amazon and Relational AI, facing students from any graduate-level program at Georgia Tech. The judges applied a rubric relying on 70% prediction accuracy / error, and 30% from creativity, process, and clarity of explanation. Our team won the first place (prize: $10,000) and was invited to present our Technical Report and have a Q&A session with key members of the Amazon Data Science team.
