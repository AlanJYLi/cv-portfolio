    title: Personal Introduction
    summary: |
      I’m a graduate student majoring in Analytics at Georgia Tech. Before coming back to school again, 
      I have 5-year working experience as business analyst in Tencent and NetEase, where I took responsibilities 
      to deliver insight on gaming industry based on my qualitative and quantitative research on the market and the products.  
      
      I'm actively seeking for full-time opportunities in data science now. As a MSA student, I concentrate on expanding my knowledge and hands-on 
      experience in statistic and programming. I gain rich working knowledge on Python, R and SQL. And I establish 
      solid understanding on analytics modeling and machine learning. Besides, my former working experience has made me a quick 
      learner and equipped me with strong business sense and result-oriented mindset.  
      
      Since my data science summer intern with Wayfair was cancelled due to COVID-19, I put more effort this summer to work on 
      some personal projects to accumulate more real-world experience in data science.
